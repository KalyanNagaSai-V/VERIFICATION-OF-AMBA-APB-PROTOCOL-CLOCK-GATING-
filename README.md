## Project Overview

This project presents the design and verification of the AMBA Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) protocol using Verilog HDL.
The focus is on low-power implementation through multi-level clock gating, ensuring energy efficiency without sacrificing performance or reliability.

The APB protocol is part of the AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) and is widely used in System-on-Chip (SoC) designs for low-bandwidth peripheral communication.

## Key Features

Verilog HDL Implementation of APB protocol.

Clock Gating Integration for dynamic power reduction.

Master-Slave Communication model with read/write transactions.

Power Optimization (power reduced from 0.682 mW → 0.567 mW).

Testbench Architecture including driver, monitor, scoreboard, and reference model.

Simulation and Verification using EDA Playground and Xilinx Genus.

## Inputs and Outputs
Inputs (to DUT / Slave from Master / System Bus)

PCLK → Clock signal (synchronizes all transfers).

PRESETn → Active-low reset.

PADDR → Address bus (8/16/32-bit configurable).

PWRITE → Write control: 1 = Write, 0 = Read.

PWDATA → Data bus (for write operations).

PSEL → Peripheral Select (slave enable).

PENABLE → Enable signal (indicates ACCESS phase).

PSTRB (optional) → Byte lane selection for writes.

Outputs (from DUT / Slave to Master)

PRDATA → Read data bus.

PREADY → Ready signal: 1 = Slave ready, 0 = Wait state.

PSLVERR → Error indicator: 0 = No error, 1 = Transfer error.

## APB Transfer Phases

IDLE State 💤

PSEL = 0, PENABLE = 0

No transaction, bus inactive.

SETUP State ⚙️

PSEL = 1, PENABLE = 0

Address (PADDR), control (PWRITE), and data (PWDATA if write) are driven.

ACCESS State 🚦

PSEL = 1, PENABLE = 1

Data transfer occurs:

Write → PWDATA sent to slave.

Read → PRDATA sent from slave.

PREADY = 1 → Transfer completes.

PREADY = 0 → Wait state until slave ready.

State Transition Flow:

IDLE  -->  SETUP  -->  ACCESS  -->  IDLE (if done)
                          |
                          -->  SETUP (if next transfer)

## Methodology

Design: APB protocol modeled in Verilog HDL with master-slave transactions.

Clock Gating: Idle modules gated to minimize toggling.
