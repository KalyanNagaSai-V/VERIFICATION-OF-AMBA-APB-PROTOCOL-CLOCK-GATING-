This project presents the design and verification of the AMBA Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) protocol using Verilog HDL.
The focus is on low-power implementation through multi-level clock gating, ensuring energy efficiency without sacrificing performance or reliability.

The APB protocol is part of the AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) and is widely used in System-on-Chip (SoC) designs for low-bandwidth peripheral communication.

## Key Features

Verilog HDL Implementation of APB protocol.

Clock Gating Integration for dynamic power reduction.

Master-Slave Communication model with read/write transactions.

Power Optimization (power reduced from 0.682 mW ‚Üí 0.567 mW).

Testbench Architecture including driver, monitor, scoreboard, and reference model.

Simulation and Verification using EDA Playground and Xilinx Genus.

## Inputs and Outputs
Inputs (to DUT / Slave from Master / System Bus)

PCLK ‚Üí Clock signal (synchronizes all transfers).

PRESETn ‚Üí Active-low reset.

PADDR ‚Üí Address bus (8/16/32-bit configurable).

PWRITE ‚Üí Write control: 1 = Write, 0 = Read.

PWDATA ‚Üí Data bus (for write operations).

PSEL ‚Üí Peripheral Select (slave enable).

PENABLE ‚Üí Enable signal (indicates ACCESS phase).

PSTRB (optional) ‚Üí Byte lane selection for writes.

Outputs (from DUT / Slave to Master)

PRDATA ‚Üí Read data bus.

PREADY ‚Üí Ready signal: 1 = Slave ready, 0 = Wait state.

PSLVERR ‚Üí Error indicator: 0 = No error, 1 = Transfer error.

## APB Transfer Phases

IDLE State üí§

PSEL = 0, PENABLE = 0

No transaction, bus inactive.

SETUP State ‚öôÔ∏è

PSEL = 1, PENABLE = 0

Address (PADDR), control (PWRITE), and data (PWDATA if write) are driven.

ACCESS State üö¶

PSEL = 1, PENABLE = 1

Data transfer occurs:

Write ‚Üí PWDATA sent to slave.

Read ‚Üí PRDATA sent from slave.

PREADY = 1 ‚Üí Transfer completes.

PREADY = 0 ‚Üí Wait state until slave ready.

## Methodology

Design: APB protocol modeled in Verilog HDL with master-slave transactions.

Clock Gating: Idle modules gated to minimize toggling.
